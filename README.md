Web app to capture graphics and send portions out as DMX data for light control.

In the above image ScreenToDMX is used to capture the output screen of [Milkdrop](https://github.com/milkdrop2077/MilkDrop3). 24 pixels equaly spaced along the yellow line are sampled and their R,G B values send out over 72 DMX channels.
This DMX data can then be used to drive a wide range of real world DMX lighting equipment.

A few basic image control sliders allow you to change the color of the overall effect. Most notable is the blur effect because it softens the otherwise rapid color changes.
